# 🌟 Day 54 – Non-Repeating Characters in a String

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Write a Java program to **print all non-repeating characters** from a given string.

---

## 📖 Explanation  

- The program reads a string from the user.  
- For each character, it checks whether the character **appears only once** in the string.  
- If a character occurs only once, it is printed as a **non-repeating character**.  
- We ignore spaces if present.
