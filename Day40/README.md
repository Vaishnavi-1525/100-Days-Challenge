## 📌 Problem Statement
Write a Java program to **print a square pattern of numbers where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`**.

## 📝 Program Explanation
- The program uses **nested loops**:
  - **Outer loop (`i`)** → Controls the number of rows (from 1 to `n`).
  - **Inner loop (`k`)** → Prints numbers from 1 to `n` in each row.
- After printing all numbers in a row, the program moves to the next line using `System.out.println()`.
