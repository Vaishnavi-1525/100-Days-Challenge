# 🌟 Day 67 — Reverse an Array

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an integer array of size N, write a Java program to reverse the array and display the elements in reverse order.

---

## 📖 Explanation
- The program accepts an array of integers from the user.
- It reverses the order of the elements — the first element becomes last, and the last becomes first.
- Finally, it prints the reversed array.

## 💡 Hint
- You can reverse the array by:
- Using a loop to swap elements from both ends, or
- Simply printing elements in reverse order.
